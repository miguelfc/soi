Service Operations Insight Tools

This repository contains several utilities that I have built in order to provide missing SOI features, extend existing ones and make our life easier while deploying SOI solutions.

Current tools available:
- **SOI Relationship Checker**: A simple Java application that connects to the database and determines how many times a CI is painted in the console tree (this has a huge impact in opening times in the console).
